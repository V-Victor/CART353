###games (3)

Experimental dating game with computers and confusing attempts at communication.

Highly stylized [digital card adventure game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNoZrr56GqA).

Two person platformer game played on a phone, where the phone is flipped in a way that players play opposed to one another, and help eachother out through their opposing gravity.

###mathematics & generation (8)

Music generated from mathematical expressions.

Music procedurally generated using weekly weather information.

Procedurally generated ambient music application that creates 4 minute songs with its own synthesis system.

Customizable, three dimensional voxel-based map generation algorithm.

Program that creates [three dimensional representations of mathematical formulas](https://www.behance.net/gallery/7618879/MathRules-Strange-Attractors).

Program that takes a 3D model and adds 'infinite' detail through fractals. Applied to a sphere, it can [generate planet terrain](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/serventines).

Geometric audio visualizer similar to [Karma Field's New Age Dark Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q64xPR6Y5ZI) album.

###tools & applications (5)

Minimal, grid-based drawing application.

Minimal image viewer desktop application that allows for rotation, zooming, and creates a color palette based on primary image colors.

Minimal presentation tool, an easy to use, simpler alternative to stuff like Microsoft's Powerpoint.

Collection of unique mobile lifestyle tools for an Android phone (clock, notes, weather, calendar, etc.).

###processing & analysis (7)

Medium-merging application where the user inputs an image and music, and the program modifies the image using data from the audio file.

Program that takes music and encodes it into bitmap.

Program that takes an image (whole image, or perhaps selected area) and translates pixel values to audio/music.

Custom [pixel sorting](http://i.imgur.com/zXOKZny.png) algorithm.

Photo processing system that recognizes certain patterns and amplifies them.
