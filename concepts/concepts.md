###mathematics & generation (10)

Music generated from mathematical expressions.

Music procedurally generated using weekly weather information.

Procedurally generated ambient music application with its own sound synthesis system (the music is not only composed, but synthesized).

Customizable, three dimensional voxel-based map generation algorithm.

Program that creates [three dimensional representations of mathematical formulas](https://www.behance.net/gallery/7618879/MathRules-Strange-Attractors).

Program that takes a 3D model and adds 'infinite' detail through fractals. Applied to a sphere, it can [generate planet terrain](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/serventines).

Geometric audio visualizer similar to [Karma Field's New Age Dark Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q64xPR6Y5ZI) album.

Two, or potentially three dimensional generative art aesthetically similar to [this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/solaas/albums/72157613484932009) project collection.

Generative art that creates [digital topography](http://butdoesitfloat.com/The-fortieth-wave-ploughed-through-an-abstract-topography-bearing-no) images.

Cellular automata, alternative variant to [Epic Conway's Game of Life](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~lipa/mec/banner.png).

###games (15)

Experimental dating game with computers/aliens and confusing attempts at communication.

Highly stylized [digital card adventure game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNoZrr56GqA).

Two person platformer game played on a phone, where the phone is flipped in a way that players play opposed to one another, and help eachother out through their opposing gravity.

Typical 'connect the pipes' game in 3D space.

Online multiplayer game where two (or more) players are in a chatroom, and must complete a variety of challenges cooperatively. Their communication, however, is hindered through an easy to crack encoding system, and they must work around it (remove certain letters? only communicate with symbols? Only communicate with emojis? Send message to random player in chat room instead of destined player?).

Asymetric strategy web-based multiplayer game where players on mobile devices play against players on desktop devices.

Exploration/puzzle game based on utilizing 'frames' or 'windows' to peek into semi-parallel worlds.

Science fantasy, sandbox, text-based M.U.D. (multiplayer?).

Text-based mobile exploration/adventure game based on walking around in the physical world, coming accross foreign objects, and interacting (fighting, befriending, talking, RPG interactions) with them. Something like a more elaborate version of [No Man's Sky's random monuments](http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/3108371-no+man's+sky_20160809081414.jpg).

Exploration spellcasting game with a focus on [combining different elements](http://store.steampowered.com/app/42910/) to cast spells.

2D rogue-like adventure in a world populated purely with text.

Full-fledged branching narrative game where you play as a lamp, and can only interact with passerbys by turning on and off.

Spaghetti hell, where it's only you, a table, and a plate of spaghetti. You suck on a spaghetti noodle, but it never seems to end.

Endless runner focused on music. Follows all the typical principles of an endless runner, but pickups are timed with the music, adding to the soundtrack.

2D combat/platformer where the more enemies you kill and further you progress through the game, the more game-breaking your abilities become, eventually causing glitches that either help you or balance the experience out.

###internet (6)

Twitter bot that, every hour, tweets one of the highest trending topics (up to 4 words) from Google searches.

Twitter bot that browses the Twitterverse and retweets pertinent tweets (text, photos, whatever) using its own curation system.

Twitter bot that browses Twitter in search for jobs, and applies for them through a reply.

3D tree map of a selection of the internet.

Unique content managment system for website.

Chatroom where no text is shown. Rather, the text is automatically translated into speech, and users can only communicate through this awkward (and often hilarious) text-to-speech system.

###tools & applications (8)

Minimal, grid-based drawing application.

Minimal image viewer desktop application that allows for rotation, zooming, and creates a color palette based on primary image colors.

Minimal presentation tool, an easy to use, simpler alternative to stuff like Microsoft's Powerpoint.

Logkeeping tool (mobile or desktop application?) where users can create categories for different topics, and log time spent engaged in these topics, with graphical representations of logged statistics. Personal log database.

Collection of unique mobile lifestyle tools for an Android phone (clock, notes, weather, calendar, etc.).

Easy to use, customizable soundboard application.

Monitoring and lifestyle desktop tool suite (time, hardware temeperature, hardware load, net load, weather, etc.).

Clock/alarm application that helps users manage and adapt to certain sleep cycles, including the more unconventional and experimenal ones.

###processing & analysis (11)

Medium-merging application where the user inputs an image and music, and the program modifies the image using data from the audio file.

Program that takes music and encodes it into bitmap.

Program that takes an image (whole image, or perhaps selected area) and translates pixel values to audio/music.

Custom [pixel sorting](http://i.imgur.com/zXOKZny.png) algorithm ([animated?](https://68.media.tumblr.com/49310879b89622142c2d0c618b218b9b/tumblr_ohxc3g03kN1vxnjybo1_500.gif)).

Photo processing system that recognizes certain patterns and amplifies them.

Photo processing system that compares two images, recognizes patterns from each one, and tries to combine them into one.

2D code matrix encoding and decoding system and application.

VR kaleidoscope that uses biometric input as seed for visuals.

Video processing system that takes any video from youtube and recreates it using a particle system with user-input parameters for visual customization.

Photo processing system that attempts to identify specific parts of the photo that are likely to be moving (blurred objects, raindrops, particles, cars, people moving, clouds, etc.) and animate them.

Simple vocoder that is mixed with a customizable synthesizer.
