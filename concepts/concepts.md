1. Two, or poentially three dimensional generative art aesthetically similar to [this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/solaas/albums/72157613484932009) project collection.

2. A geometric audio visulaizer with a similar level of complexity as [Karma Field's New Age Dark Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q64xPR6Y5ZI) album.

4. A collection of unique mobile lifestyle tools for an Android phone (clock, notes, weather, calendar, etc.).

5. 2D matrix encoding and decoding system and application, essentially a custom QR code-like application.

6. Custom logging tool (mobile or desktop application?) where users can create categories for different topics, and log time spent engaged in these topics, with graphical representations of logged statistics. A sort of personal log database.

7. Custom minimal presentation tool, an easy to use, simpler alternative to stuff like Microsoft's Powerpoint.

11. Procedurally generated ambient music application that creates 4 minute songs with its own synthesis system.
