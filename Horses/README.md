#Horses?

_Horses?_ is small a game about coping with your obsessive hoarding problem.

`WASD` to move. Your goal is to escape the cube field to be able to explore the rest of the world by _avoiding_ the cubes gravitating towards you, as they'll slow you down and potentially lock you down if too many have gravitated towards you. Each cube in your orbit will make you slower, but also make you more massive, causing a feedback loop of an increasingly large amount of cubes coming your way if you don't avoid them.
