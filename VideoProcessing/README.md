A randomly generated gaussian radius is centered on mouse, and determines the chance of drawing a slightly transparent ellipse (depending on its distance from the mouse, determined by the gaussian radius). These ellipses are drawn over video pixels, and their size dictated by a persistently evolving 2D perlin noise map.
